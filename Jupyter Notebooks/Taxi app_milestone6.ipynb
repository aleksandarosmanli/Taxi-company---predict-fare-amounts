    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Drivers who didn't receive tips will probably be upset that the app told them a customer would leave a tip. If it happened often, drivers might not trust the app.\n",
    "Drivers are unlikely to pick up people who are predicted to not leave tips. Customers will have difficulty finding a taxi that will pick them up, and might get angry at the taxi company. Even when the model is correct, people who can't afford to tip will find it more difficult to get taxis, which limits the accessibility of taxi service to those who pay extra.\n",

    "No. Effectively limiting equal access to taxis is ethically problematic, and carries a lot of risk.\n",

    "5.   Can the objective be modified to make it less problematic?\n",

    "### **Task 4. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would I recommend using this model? Why or why not?**  \n",
    "Yes, this is model performs acceptably. Its F<sub>1</sub> score was 0.7235 and it had an overall accuracy of 0.6865. It correctly identified ~78% of the actual responders in the test set, which is 48% better than a random guess. It may be worthwhile to test the model with a select group of taxi drivers to get feedback.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was the highest scoring model doing? Can I explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "Unfortunately, random forest is not the most transparent machine learning algorithm. I know that `VendorID`, `predicted_fare`, `mean_duration`, and `mean_distance` are the most important features, but I don't know how they influence tipping. This would require further exploration. It is interesting that `VendorID` is the most predictive feature. This seems to indicate that one of the two vendors tends to attract more generous customers. It may be worth performing statistical tests on the different vendors to examine this further.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that I can engineer that might improve model performance?**  \n",
    "There are almost always additional features that can be engineered, but hopefully the most obvious ones were generated during the first round of modeling. In this case, I could try creating three new columns that indicate if the trip distance is short, medium, or far. I could also engineer a column that gives a ratio that represents (the amount of money from the fare amount to the nearest higher multiple of \\\\$5) / fare amount. For example, if the fare were \\\\$12, the value in this column would be 0.25, because \\\\$12 to the nearest higher multiple of \\\\$5 (\\\\$15) is \\\\$3, and \\\\$3 divided by \\\\$12 is 0.25. The intuition for this feature is that people might be likely to simply round up their tip, so journeys with fares with values just under a multiple of \\\\$5 may have lower tip percentages than those with fare values just over a multiple of \\\\$5. I could also do the same thing for fares to the nearest \\\\$10.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "round5\\_ratio = \\frac{amount\\ of\\ money\\ from\\ the\\ fare\\ amount\\ to\\ the\\ nearest\\ higher\\ multiple\\ of\\ \\$5}{fare\\ amount}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would I want to have that would likely improve the performance of the model?**   \n",
    "It would probably be very helpful to have past tipping behavior for each customer. It would also be valuable to have accurate tip values for customers who pay with cash.\n",
    "It would be helpful to have a lot more data. With enough data, I could create a unique feature for each pickup/dropoff combination."
