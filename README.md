# Overview
The taxi company has asked to build a machine learning model to predict whether a taxi company cab rider will be a generous tipper. 

# Problem
After rejecting the initial modeling objective (predicting non-tippers) out of ethical concern, it was decided to predict “generous” tippers—those who tip ≥ 20%. This decision was made to balance the sometimes competing interests of taxi drivers and potential passengers.

# Solution
Two different modeling architectures were used and compared their results. Both models performed acceptably, with a random forest architecture yielding slightly better predictions. As a result, beta testing with taxi drivers would be recommended to gain further feedback.
